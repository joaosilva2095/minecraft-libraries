## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

Nowadays libraries such as **Spigot, Bukkit** and so on have given lots of useful APIs in order to code *Minecraft server* plugins.
However there are a lots of missing functions and methods that would make a plugin development easier so we have created a collection of useful functions to use side by side with a Minecraft server library.

## <a name="setup_minigame"></a>Setup Minigame

In order to use this minigame API first you have to register your minigame. You need to have a folder where you keep all the *sample worlds* for being loaded on the fly.
```java
GameController gameController = GameAPI.getInstance().registerGame(plugin, worldsFolder);
```
this will return a game controller which will have all the methods needed to run the minigame.
After registering it you can create your arenas
```java
ArenaSolo arenaSolo = (ArenaSolo) gameController.createArena(ArenaType.SOLO);
ArenaTeam arenaTeam = (ArenaTeam) gameController.createArena(ArenaType.TEAM);
```
Now you should initialize the locations of the arena. We have created an [example file](https://gitlab.com/RevTut/minecraft-sky-wars/blob/games_api_integration/src/resources/location.yml) of the locations.
```java
GameSession gameSession = new GameSession(arena, minPlayers, maxPlayers); // You should create a game session per round
arena.initialize(...);
session.update(GameState.LOBBY, maximumTime);
```
We have also added the possibility to set the arena flags!
```java
arena.updateFlag(ArenaFlag.BLOCK_BREAK, false); // False means can't break blocks, true would mean the opposite
arena.updateFlag(Arena.HUNGER, true);
arena.updateFlag(...);
```
Thats it, now you just have to register the custom events you need such as join arena, leave arena, cross border, timer tick, timer expire, etc...

## <a name="setup_database"></a>Setup Database

Those who want more complex minigames can use databases also included here.
```java
// Database Types - MYSQL, ORACLE, POSTGRE
Database database = Database.createDatabase(DatabaseType.MYSQL, hostname, port, database, username, password);
```
Now you have got a database so lets connect to it!
```java
database.connect();
```
Do you want to query the database? That is as simple as this
```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM Players WHERE Players.UUID = ?"; // Runs on prepared statements
List<Object> parameters = new ArrayList();
parameters.add(player.getUuid());

ResultSet result = database.executeQuery(query, parameters);
while(result.next()) {
    (...)
}
```

Also insert updates?
```java
String update = "INSERT INTO Players(UUID uuid, String name) VALUES (?, ?)";
List<Object> parameters = new ArrayList();
parameters.add(player.getUuid()); // Parameters must be sorted accordingly with the statement
parameters.add(player.getName());

int numRowsUpdated = database.executeUpdate(update, parameters);
```

This plugin is being developed by [Jo√£o Silva](https://gitlab.com/u/RevTut). Some of the methods were adapted from existing ones that may be found either on [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/forums/) or [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/forums/) forum.
